1 The figures shown in this column for the offense of rape were reported using only the revised Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) definition of rape. See the downloadable Methodology file for further explanation. ,,,,,,,,,,,
2 The FBI does not publish arson data unless it receives data from either the agency or the state for all 12 months of the calendar year.,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 Limited data for 2020 were available for Alabama, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. ",,,,,,,,,,,
"4 Because of changes in the state/local agency's reporting practices, figures are not comparable to previous years' data. ",,,,,,,,,,,
5 The Tulare County Highway Patrol collects the motor vehicle thefts for this county. These data can be found in Table 11. ,,,,,,,,,,,
"6 The FBI determined that the agency's data were underreported. Consequently, those data are not included in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,
"7 The FBI determined that the agency's data were overreported. Consequently, those data are not included in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,
"8 The FBI determined that the state did not follow national UCR Program guidelines for reporting an offense. Consequently, this figure is not included in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,
"9 This agency submits rape data classified according to the legacy UCR definition; therefore, the rape offense and violent crime total, which rape is a part of, is not included in this table. See the downloadable Methodology file for further explanation. ",,,,,,,,,,,
