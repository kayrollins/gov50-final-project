## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to...
Right wing extremist groups in the US (oathkeepers, three percenters, etc) and what does or doesnt impact membership or group activity. I think group activity might be easier to track, because many groups don't have a membership roster (for obvious reasons).
